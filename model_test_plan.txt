Time Series Model to Test:
    - Linear regression (OLS, ridge, lasso, elastic net, ensemble)
    - ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average)
    - Exponential smoothing (Holt-Winters)
    - VAR (vector autoregression)

Testing guideline:
    - Test all models on the na monthly sessions and pageviews data
    - Test all models using the same evaluation metrics
    - Each evaluation needs to forecast over the same period
    - Visualizations of the forecast, along with metrics, need to be provided
    - The experimentation code needs to be re-runnable from scratch

Model Experimentaion Plan:
    - One week of testing staring on 4/15, the presentations are due on 4/22
    - The data to be modeled is for NA website monthly sessions and pageviews
    - The eval metric will be as follows:
        - Mean absolute error (MAE)
        - Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
        - Mean squared error (MSE)
        - Root mean square error (RMSE)
	- R-squared
    - The forecast period for evaluation will be the last 5 years of the dataset
    - Experimentation will be done in Jupyter notebooks running Python 3, utilizing the standard Anaconda build in a Docker container
